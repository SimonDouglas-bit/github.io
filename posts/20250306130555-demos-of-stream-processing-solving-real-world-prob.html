                <p>🏫 Awesome Stream Processing 🏫</p>
<p>The term "stream processing" might sound intimidating to many people. We often hear statements like:</p>
<p>"Stream processing is too difficult to learn and use!" 😱</p>
<p>"Stream processing is very expensive!" 😱</p>
<p>"I don’t see any business use cases for stream processing!" 😱</p>
<p>However, we believe this isn't true.</p>
<p>❌</p>
<p>Streaming data is everywhere, generated from operational databases, messaging queues, IoT devices, and many other sources. People can leverage modern stream processing technology to easily address classic real-world problems, using SQL as the programming language.</p>
<p>In this repository, we provide a series of executable demos demonstrating how stream processing can be applied in practical scenarios:</p>
<p>Getting started ✅</p>
<p>Install Kafka, PostgreSQL, and RisingWave, and run minimal toy examples on your device.</p>
<p>Integrate RisingWave with other data platforms.</p>
<p>Basic stream processing examples ✅</p>
<p>Learn the fundamentals of ingesting, processing, transforming, and offloading data from streaming systems.</p>
<p>Querying and processing event streaming data</p>
<p>(👈 </p>
<p>Kafka users, you may start here!</p>
<p>💡)</p>
<p>Directly query data stored in event streaming systems (e.g., Kafka, Redpanda).</p>
<p>Continuously ingest and analyze data from event streaming systems.</p>
<p>Bringing analytics closer to operational databases</p>
<p>(👈 </p>
<p>Postgres users, you may start here!</p>
<p>💡)</p>
<p>Offload event-driven queries (e.g., materialized views and triggers) from operational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).</p>
<p>Real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)</p>
<p>Perform ETL continuously and incrementally.</p>
<p>Simple demonstrations ✅</p>
<p>A collection of simple, self-contained demos showcasing how stream processing can be applied in specific industry use cases.</p>
<p>Solution demonstrations ✅</p>
<p>A collection of comprehensive demos showcasing how to build a stream processing pipeline for real-world applications.</p>
<p>We use </p>
<p>RisingWave</p>
<p>as the default stream processing system to run these demos. We also assume that you have </p>
<p>Kafka</p>
<p>and/or </p>
<p>PostgreSQL</p>
<p>installed and possess basic knowledge of how to use these systems. </p>
<p>These demos have been verified on Ubuntu and Mac.</p>
<p>All you need is a laptop</p>
<p>💻 - </p>
<p>no cluster is required.</p>
<p>Any comments are welcome. Happy streaming!</p>
