<p>Before you decide what to buy, you probably decide where to shop — which means turning to your favorite search engine. With online searches dominating as the starting point of most purchases, customer journey SEO is now mission-critical for every business.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t remember the last time I made a purchase without some online research first. Earlier today, I fell down a Google rabbit hole looking for bulk-dried tortellini. Last fall, it was a new MacBook.</p>
<p>By the time I was searching for the best deal on a MacBook, I had already done the bulk of my research — comparing specs, vendors, and reviews. And that tortellini search? It introduced me to brands I never would’ve found if they hadn’t optimized for the SEO-driven customer journey.</p>
<p>Here’s the real question: If your brand isn’t showing up when customers are searching, how much business are you losing to competitors?</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>Customer journey SEO is simply where SEO and customer journey mapping intersect. While most businesses focus on SEO as a way to rank higher, that’s only part of the equation.</p>
<p>The best SEO strategies do drive traffic. But they take it a step further, supporting customer inquiries through every step of the journey from discovery to purchase, maximizing visibility, engagement, and conversions.</p>
<p>So, how do you integrate SEO into your customer journey? It starts by understanding the three core types of search: navigational, informational, and transactional.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, each phase correlates with different types of search queries. Aligning your SEO strategy to the customer journey means tying your efforts to each type of search.</p>
<p>Your prospect has a solid idea of what they’re looking for and just wants help going to a specific site.</p>
<p>Using my MacBook example above, some navigational searches I used were:</p>
<p>I knew I wanted an Apple product, and I was headed to different vendors I trusted to find out more about the models and to get the best price.</p>
<p>Successful SEO optimization for navigational searches focuses heavily on branding.</p>
<p>Your prospects are looking for answers, knowledge, and help. This usually means more top-of-funnel content. Examples of these searches for new laptops might be:</p>
<p>When I was still deciding on a MacBook version and confirming that I wanted Apple over Windows, I looked for content like blog posts, comparison articles, and product reviews.</p>
<p>Successful SEO optimization for information searches means leaning into content marketing.</p>
<p>Your prospects are ready to buy. They might be looking for the best deal, still deciding between options, or looking for confirmation that their top pick is truly their best bet. Examples of these searches might be:</p>
<p>At this stage, I was really just looking for the best deals and best options, so I looked at product pages and pricing comparisons.</p>
<p>Finally, successful SEO optimization for transactional searches means emphasizing information-rich product pages.</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in a visual:</p>
<p>Before you optimize for SEO, you need to map out your customer’s journey. A customer journey map helps you visualize exactly where potential buyers engage with your brand — and where gaps exist.</p>
<p>Marketing Consultant Kerry Bodine explains it best in this must-watch video:</p>
<p>The great thing about customer journey maps is that they put customers first. By sketching a sticky-note map of people progressing through a theoretical funnel, you are putting the focus on customers.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that’s how every organization should function — elevating, honoring, and giving pride of place to the customers. This level of customer obsession leads to loyalty, referrals, and competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Don’t make the mistake of thinking customer journey maps are the same as sales funnels.</p>
<p>While sales funnels do provide a broad-based sketch of a process and can be a good starting point, they don’t actually map the journey. With that in mind, it’s best to think of them as two separate entities serving two separate purposes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, I’ll stay high level. We’ve got a great post that goes into detail on creating your customer journey map, and I definitely encourage running through it.</p>
<p>With that said, here’s how to create your map and make it SEO-friendly.</p>
<p>We typically break this down into three stages:</p>
<p>In fact, you can see them in the screenshot below of our free customer journey map template.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to figure out what they’re searching for at each phase. I want you to consider search intent as well as the specific keywords and questions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, start mapping out the types of searches they’re likely making. You can usually shorten this page by using your SEO marketing software (it’s HubSpot, right?).</p>
<p>Pro tip: Revisit this regularly. Consumer habits and markets change, which means search patterns do, too.</p>
<p>This is where the customer journey SEO comes in. It’s important to understand the types of content that best fit each phase before diving headlong into mapping. Here’s a quick rundown of how things often break down at each stage:</p>
<p>Pro tip: Don’t overcomplicate it. Start with these quick wins:</p>

<p>Your customer journey map can take MANY different forms and should help you identify what your customer is experiencing at each stage of the journey.</p>
<p>If the first template you find isn’t working for you and you can’t easily adjust it for your needs, I recommend opening up your favorite infographic tool to see what customer journey templates exist. I did a quick Canva search, and clicked on one of the first designs that caught my eye. As you can see below, there are several different options right below it.</p>
<p>I usually end up combining visuals with tables or spreadsheets because both are helpful to me.</p>
<p>If your brand isn’t visible at the right moments, your competitors will be. That’s why SEO isn’t just about rankings. I want you to instead think about it through the lens of making it easy for your audience to find you when it matters most — or at the start of the customer journey.</p>
<p>If they can’t find you — clearly the best option — customers will veer off to a competitor. Or, even worse, they’ll get lost and end up frustrated or back at ground zero. So, findability is not an option.</p>
<p>Your SEO strategy should be built around user intent. Here’s how to optimize your content for each stage of the journey based on the customer journey map and content overview you mapped out above (you did that, right?).</p>
<p>Find each touchpoint in your customer journey and use your favorite SEO keyword research tools to develop a list of keywords your customers are likely using.</p>
<p>Let’s say a customer is researching luxury vacations. They start with informational searches (“Best Caribbean resorts”), progress to navigational searches (“Four Seasons Bora Bora vs. Ritz-Carlton Maldives”), and finally move to transactional searches (“Four Seasons Bora Bora best deal”).</p>
<p>Type of website: Family vacation planning service</p>
<p>Customer: Suburban mom planning for family vacation</p>
<p>Point in customer journey: Getting a sense of travel costs for her upcoming family vacation.</p>
<p>Query type: Informational</p>
<p>Possible Keywords:</p>
<p>Now, take those keywords and plug them into your SEO strategy. How? Let’s take one keyword from the above example — “how much vacation can I afford?” Here’s what you might do:</p>
<p>After conducting an effort like that, you will start to dominate that keyword. More to the point, you will also dominate this phase of the customer journey. Whenever potential customers engage in informational searches for this phase, they will likely see your website in the search results.</p>
<p>SEO can have quick wins, but it’s also a bit of a long game. And as I touched on above, things change as markets and technology evolve. So what worked 10 years ago didn’t work 5 years ago — and definitely doesn’t now. To that end, what works well today will barely scratch the surface in the next 5-10 years.</p>
<p>So, use Google Analytics to track conversions and tools like Ubersuggest or Ahrefs to track SEO performance. Then, improve underperforming content and create new content to meet your new needs.</p>
<p>Keywords and on-page SEO will help your customer journey optimization efforts immensely. But there’s another piece of the puzzle that matters, too — technical SEO. By improving your domain health and ensuring that your site is usable and functional, you build even more trust with Google and other search engines. And that ensures that your customer journey SEO efforts pay off.</p>
<p>If you’re not deep into the SEO world, it’s probably worth bringing in a technical expert, but you can do a lot of this stuff yourself if interested. You can check out our free Technical SEO lesson here.</p>
<p>To stay competitive in today’s market, online visibility is a must.</p>
<p>If you want to market more effectively, and you don’t yet have a customer journey map, you’re going to want to make one. But don’t stop there. A customer journey map is an excellent exercise, but without SEO implementation, it’s going to be less than productive.</p>
<p>The bottom line? If you’re not mapping SEO to your customer’s journey, you’re leaving money on the table. And you and your customers deserve better.</p>
