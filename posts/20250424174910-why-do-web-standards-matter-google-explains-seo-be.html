<p>Google's Gary Illyes explains how web standards benefit SEO, focusing on the differences between robots.txt and sitemaps.</p>
<p>Google Search Relations team members recently shared insights about web standards on the Search Off the Record podcast.</p>
<p>Martin Splitt and Gary Illyes explained how these standards are created and why they matter for SEO. Their conversation reveals details about Google’s decisions that affect how we optimize websites.</p>
<p>Google has formally standardized robots.txt through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, they left the sitemap protocol as an informal standard.</p>
<p>This difference illustrates how Google determines which protocols require official standards.</p>
<p>Illyes explained during the podcast:</p>
<p>“With robots.txt, there was a benefit because we knew that different parsers tend to parse robots.txt files differently… With sitemap, it’s like ‘eh’… it’s a simple XML file, and there’s not that much that can go wrong with it.”</p>
<p>This statement from Illyes reveals Google’s priorities. Protocols that confuse platforms receive more attention than those that work well without formal standards.</p>
<p>The standardization of robots.txt created several clear benefits for SEO:</p>
<p>These benefits make technical SEO work more straightforward and more effective, especially for teams managing large websites.</p>
<p>The podcast also revealed how web standards are created.</p>
<p>Standards groups, such as the IETF, W3C, and WHATWG, work through open processes that often take years to complete. This slow pace ensures security, clear language, and broad compatibility.</p>
<p>Illyes explained:</p>
<p>“You have to show that the thing you are working on actually works. There’s tons of iteration going on and it makes the process very slow—but for a good reason.”</p>
<p>Both Google engineers emphasized that anyone can participate in these standards processes. This creates opportunities for SEO professionals to help shape the protocols they use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Standards also address important security concerns. When developing the robots.txt standard, Google included a 500-kilobyte limit specifically to prevent potential attacks.</p>
<p>Illyes explained:</p>
<p>“When I’m reading a draft, I would look at how I would exploit stuff that the standard is describing.”</p>
<p>This demonstrates how standards establish security boundaries that safeguard both websites and the tools that interact with them.</p>
<p>For SEO professionals, these insights indicate several practical strategies to consider:</p>
<p>As search engines continue to prioritize technical quality, understanding the underlying principles behind web protocols becomes increasingly valuable for achieving SEO success.</p>
<p>This conversation shows that even simple technical specifications involve complex considerations around security, consistency, and ease of use, all factors that directly impact SEO performance.</p>
