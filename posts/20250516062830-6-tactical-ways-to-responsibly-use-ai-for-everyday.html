<p>SEO has always involved a lot of manual, repetitive work. </p>
<p>Keyword research, writing title tags and meta descriptions, parsing GA4 exports, auditing massive content libraries – it’s all important, but it’s also time-consuming.</p>
<p>Now, we have tools that can help lighten the load. </p>
<p>From accelerating content ideation to pulling insights from performance data, AI can be a powerful (and efficient) part of your daily SEO workflow.</p>
<p>The real question isn’t if you should use AI – it’s how to use it well.</p>
<p>A custom GPT is a tailored version of the AI language model that you can create to perform specific tasks or provide particular expertise. </p>
<p>You supply in-depth knowledge by telling it who it should be, its areas of expertise, and providing supplemental information to back that up. </p>
<p>This is beneficial because once you create an “identity,” the AI remembers “who” it is for ongoing support, allowing for very specialized output for your unique needs. </p>
<p>Custom GPTs ultimately improve the consistency of every AI interaction.</p>
<p>To get started, using ChatGPT, find the Explore GPTs page and navigate to My GPTs &gt; Create a GPT. </p>
<p>You will be greeted with a prompt asking what you would like to make.</p>
<p>Walk through some of the initial questions posed around what your GPT should do and who it’s for.</p>
<p>Navigate to the Configure tab to further refine the GPT settings and instructions. </p>
<p>Here, clarify “who” the GPT should be, what specific tasks will be needed, and even example output. </p>
<p>Be as clear and specific as possible.</p>
<p>Further prime the GPT by uploading supporting documents, images, and links. This includes:</p>
<p>Maybe you have template documents you can supply or links to articles written by the persona you want the GPT to take.</p>
<p>The more information you provide, the better and more strategic the output. </p>
<p>Follow these best practices for priming your custom AI assistant:</p>
<p>Creating a custom GPT does require a paid subscription; however, if you are planning to use AI in any meaningful way, it is a worthy investment.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to scale your content with AI as your brainstorm partner.</p>
<p>The key? Start with the right prompts and priming, and guide the AI like a strategist, not a robot.</p>
<p>Before even opening ChatGPT, you need to define your foundation. </p>
<p>Think through what keyword themes you want to target, what audience personas or segments the content will speak to, and what stage of the funnel the content is for. </p>
<p>If you have created a custom GPT, then much of this information is pre-loaded. </p>
<p>You just need to ensure the AI assistant knows the goals for the specific content you’re ideating. </p>
<p>The more context you give up front, the more useful the AI’s ideas will be. </p>
<p>Once you’ve clarified your inputs, use a prompt like:</p>
<p>Run the same prompt with different variations of personas, trends, pain points, etc. </p>
<p>Also, change the format to scale ideas across channels, such as changing from blog posts to landing pages, newsletter themes, etc.</p>
<p>You probably have some blog posts or resources that are already performing well. </p>
<p>Use prompts to help brainstorm spinoff ideas or content cluster topics, like:</p>
<p>Drop your AI-generated ideas into a spreadsheet or content planning doc. </p>
<p>Then evaluate based on relevance, alignment with your SEO strategy, and potential for internal linking or different formats.</p>
<p>A content gap occurs when people search for something related to your business but find that your website doesn’t have content that answers their questions or meets their needs.</p>
<p>Traditional content gap analyses can be time-consuming. </p>
<p>That’s where AI comes in to help streamline the process.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to conduct a content gap analysis, and the route you choose will impact the prompts you give AI. </p>
<p>Depending on your approach, you need a prompt asking AI to help find what’s missing. </p>
<p>Specific content</p>
<p>Again, give your AI tool feedback and refine the prompts as needed.</p>
<p>Not every suggested idea will be right for your brand, audience, or goals, but many of the AI responses should highlight content opportunities you may have missed. </p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Turn video content into blogs, social posts, transcripts, and SEO-friendly assets.</p>
<p>Video content is often underutilized for SEO. </p>
<p>But when repurposed thoughtfully, especially with the help of AI, video can become a high-impact asset for visibility, engagement, and authority. </p>
<p>It’s not just about squeezing extra mileage out of your assets, it’s about expanding their reach, accessibility, and discoverability.</p>
<p>By turning that content into SEO-friendly formats such as blog posts, landing pages, FAQs, or transcripts, you build topical depth around your priority themes.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The future of SEO content is video – here’s why</p>
<p>For transcription, there is a wide range of free and paid tools: </p>
<p>Start by transcribing your video. </p>
<p>Once you have the raw text:</p>
<p>This is the initial content that your AI assistant will work with.</p>
<p>For writing assistance in turning those transcripts into structured, written content, there is ChatGPT (and you can use your previously created custom GPT for help!), Gemini, Claude, Copilot, etc.</p>
<p>Regardless of the tool you select, this is where the magic happens and where your prompt really matters. </p>
<p>Paste the cleaned-up transcript into your AI tool and ask the AI assistant to rewrite the transcription as a blog post, a webpage for your site, a longer evergreen article, or whatever you need. </p>
<p>As always, be sure to provide specific direction. </p>
<p>Don’t just say “write a blog post.” Instead, try:</p>
<p>The more context you give, the better the results, especially if your assistant has already been trained with examples of your voice and goals.</p>
<p>Once you have your AI-generated draft, your work is not done. </p>
<p>Now, it’s time to:</p>
<p>As a final step, consider running your content through an AI detection tool. </p>
<p>GPTZero is my go-to. It details what percentage of your copy is probably written by a human and highlights any specific sentences that are likely AI-generated. </p>
<p>Grammarly and Writer have free AI-detection tools as well. </p>
<p>Digging through Search Console exports, GA4 dashboards, and third-party SEO tools can be daunting. </p>
<p>There’s a wealth of insight buried in all that data, but it takes time, strategy, and context to extract what really matters.</p>
<p>That’s where AI tools can help to summarize, analyze, spot patterns, and even suggest next steps. </p>
<p>Start by exporting the relevant data as CSV files or Google Sheets. Depending on your needs, that may include:</p>
<p>Remove any unnecessary columns, clearly label all of the data, and add any context needed.</p>
<p>Upload your file or copy/paste your cleaned-up data into your AI tool of choice. Give the AI a structured, goal-oriented prompt such as:</p>
<p>Review the AI output critically and consider how the insights align with what you know about the client, campaigns, or search trends. </p>
<p>Before using any of the insights or next steps, be sure to refine the wording and add context so that the information aligns with your objectives. </p>
<p>You can even take the summary provided a step further by asking the AI to help turn the insights into client-facing bullets, written in your brand’s tone and voice. </p>
<p>If you created a custom GPT, this is a great use case for it. </p>
<p>As more people turn to AI tools to search, learn, and make decisions, your brand’s representation in these LLMs matters. </p>
<p>Chat agents can impact your brand image, underscoring the importance of proactive digital PR and SEO efforts.</p>
<p>We’ve covered how to integrate AI into your SEO process, but it’s just as important to recognize that these same tools are answer engines in their own right. </p>
<p>Just like with traditional search engines, we need to be intentional about how our brand appears in those results.</p>
<p>An AI audit for brand consistency helps ensure that LLMs accurately, consistently, and positively reflect your brand. </p>
<p>Their understanding of a brand is a reflection of the content available online, including official websites, especially About pages, news outlets, and industry publications.</p>
<p>Start your audit by identifying a standard set of questions that someone may realistically ask an AI tool about your brand. </p>
<p>Be sure to include some broad questions as well as those that are more specific.</p>
<p>The goal is to test how the AI agents describe your company across different themes, such as brand overview, services, culture, reputation, and positioning.</p>
<p>Use the same question set across multiple AI tools and LLMs. Start with ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude. </p>
<p>Don’t forget to ask for citations, especially if the response is unexpected. </p>
<p>Manually input each question and copy/paste the responses into a spreadsheet. </p>
<p>Create a table where each row is a question and each column is a platform. This makes patterns (and red flags) easier to spot.</p>
<p>Now that you have your data, it’s time to audit it. </p>
<p>For each response, consider if the information is accurate, if the tone is aligned with how you want to be perceived, and if anything important is missing. </p>
<p>Also consider if there are insights that signal SEO or content gaps (e.g., services not mentioned, outdated leadership info, incorrect history).</p>
<p>While you may not be able to log into ChatGPT and “fix” an answer, you can influence how your brand is portrayed. </p>
<p>The final step is to update the source material from which these LLMs are drawing. </p>
<p>If the web is your brand’s resume, ensure it’s not outdated or missing your best accomplishments.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how AI can level up your SEO workflow, it’s worth remembering a few key principles to get the most out of these tools, without losing the human touch.</p>
<p>While AI is a great tool for repetitive tasks and simple analysis, you are the marketing expert. </p>
<p>Treat AI as an intern who can get work started – don’t rely on it as you would an expert on your team.​</p>
<p>It is important to be clear when it comes to prompts and guardrails for AI.​ </p>
<p>Tell the AI who they are, what their area of expertise is, what tone and voice to use, what you don’t want included in their response, etc.</p>
<p>It is crucial to validate everything that has been done through AI (with a human). </p>
<p>This allows you to understand a tool’s strengths and weaknesses so you get better outputs.​ </p>
<p>AI tools are known to hallucinate, or provide seemingly concrete answers that are wrong or misleading. Even robots need fact-checking.</p>
<p>AI can give vastly different results depending on the prompt you give it, so it is helpful to save prompts that are proven to work. ​(More on example prompts below!)</p>
<p>AI is still evolving, so it’s best to start small and truly understand how AI capabilities can impact your workflow. </p>
<p>Once you understand a tool on a small scale, you will be able to scale up tactically.​</p>
<p>Not all AI tools are created equal. Different platforms excel at different tasks, and knowing which tool to use and when can improve your workflow. </p>
<p>Used responsibly, AI can streamline your SEO efforts, help you move faster, spot more opportunities, and create better search experiences. </p>
<p>But it should always work alongside your expertise, not replace it. </p>
