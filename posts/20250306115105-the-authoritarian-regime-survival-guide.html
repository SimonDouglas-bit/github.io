<p>The Authoritarian Regime Survival Guide</p>
<p>The text below, dubbed the “Authoritarian Regime Survival Guide”, was published in social media in January 2017 in a series of improvised, spontaneous tweets, which reached 3 million views within one month. Their common element was their trademark signature, “- </p>
<p>With love, your Eastern European friends</p>
<p>”, and the accompanying hashtag </p>
<h1>LearnFromEurope</h1>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Guide went viral in the US and many other countries, being translated into several languages, from Turkish to Filipino. It was printed on placards during anti-Trump protests, studied at two American universities, quoted by CNBC’s Joy Reid on national TV and recommended by former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.</p>
<p>Excerpts and summaries were published by various on-line media, but this is the first time it is published as a whole.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>YEAR 1 Under Authoritarianism</p>
<p>What to Expect?</p>
<ol>
<li>They will come to power with a campaign based on fear, scaremongering and distorting the truth. Nevertheless, their victory will be achieved through a democratic electoral process. But beware, as this will be their argument every time you question the legitimacy of their actions. They will claim a mandate from the People to change the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember – gaining power through a democratic system does not give them permission to cross legal boundaries and undermine said democracy.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will divide and rule. Their strength lies in unity, in one voice and one ideology, and so should yours. They will call their supporters Patriots, the only “true Americans”. You will be labelled as traitors, enemies of the state, unpatriotic, the corrupt elite, the old regime trying to regain power. Their supporters will be the “People”, the “sovereign” who chose their leaders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t let them divide you – remember you’re one People, one Nation, with one common good.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will subjugate state media, turning them into a propaganda tube. Then, through convoluted laws and threats they will attempt to control all mainstream media and limit press freedom. They will ban critical press from their briefings, calling them “liars”, “fake news”. They will brand those media as “unpatriotic”, acting against the People (see point 2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Fight for every media outlet, every journalist that is being banned, censored, sacked or labelled an “enemy of the state” – there’s no hope for freedom where there is no free press.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will create chaos, maintain a constant sense of conflict and danger. It will be their argument to enact new authoritarian laws, each one further limiting your freedoms and civil liberties. They will disguise them as being for your protection, for the good of the People.</li>
</ol>
<p>See through the chaos, the fake danger, expose it before you wake up in a totalitarian, fascist state.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will distort the truth, deny facts and blatantly lie. They will try to make you forget what facts are, sedate your need to find the truth. They will feed “post-truths” and “alternative facts”, replace knowledge and logic with emotions and fiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Always think critically, fact-check and point out the truth, expose ignorance with facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will incite and then leak fake, superficial “scandals”. They will smear opposition with trivial accusations, blowing them out of proportion and then feeding the flame. This is just smokescreen for the legal steps they will be taking towards totalitarianism.</li>
</ol>
<p>See through superficial topics in mainstream media (see point 3) and focus on what they are actually doing.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will propose shocking laws to provoke your outrage. You will focus your efforts on fighting them, so they will seemingly back off, giving you a false sense of victory. In the meantime they will push through less “flashy” legislation, slowly dismantling democracy (see points 4 and 6)</li>
</ol>
<p>Focus your fight on what really matters.</p>
<ol>
<li>When invading your liberal sensibilities they will focus on what hurts the most – women and minorities. They will act as if democracy was majority rule without respect for the minority. They will paint foreigners and immigrants as potential threats. Racial, religious, sexual and other minorities will become enemies to the order and security they are supposedly providing. They will challenge women’s social status, undermine gender equality and interfere with reproductive rights (see point 7). But it means they are aware of the threat women and minorities pose to their rule, so make it your strength.</li>
</ol>
<p>Women and minorities have to be ready to fight the hardest – reminding the majority what true democracy is about – and you must fight together with them.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will try to take control of the judiciary. They will assault your highest court. They need to remove the checks and balances to be able to push through unconstitutional legislation. Controlling the judiciary they can also threat anyone that defies them with prosecution, including the press (see point 3).</li>
</ol>
<p>Preserve the independence of your courts at all cost, they are your safety valve, the safeguard of the rule of law and the democratic system.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will try to limit freedom of assembly, calling it a necessity for your security. They will enact laws prioritizing state events and rallies, or those of a certain type or ideology. If they can choose who can demonstrate legally, they have a legal basis to forcefully disperse or prosecute the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oppose any legislation attempting to interfere with freedom of assembly, for whatever reason.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will distort the language, coin new terms and labels, repeat shocking phrases until you accept them as normal and subconsciously associate them with whom they like. A “thief”, “liar” or “traitor” will automatically mean the opposition, while a “patriot” or a “true American” will mean their follower (see point 2). Their slogans will have double meaning, giving strength to their supporters and instilling angst in their opponents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fight changes in language in the public sphere, remind and preserve the true meaning of words.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will take over your national symbols, associate them with their regime, remake them into attributes of their power. They want you to forget that your flag, your anthem and your symbols belong to you, the People, to everyone equally. Don’t let them be hijacked. Use and expose them in your fight as much as they do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Show your national symbols with pride, let them give you strength, not associate you with the tyranny they brought onto your country.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will try to rewrite history to suit their needs and use the education system to support their agenda. They will smear any historical or living figure who wouldn’t approve of their actions, or distort their image to make you think they would. They will place emphasis on historical education in schools, feeding young minds with the “only correct” version of history and philosophy. They will raise a new generation of voters on their ideology, backing it with a distorted interpretation of history and view of the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guard the education of your children, teach them critical thinking, ensure their open-mindedness and protect your real history and heritage.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will alienate foreign allies and partners, convincing you don’t need them. They won’t care for the rest of the world, with their focus on “making your country great again”. While ruining your economy to fulfil their populist promises, they will omit the fact that you’re part of a bigger world whose development depends on cooperation, on sharing and on trade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t let them build walls promising you security instead of bridges giving you prosperity.</p>
<ol>
<li>They will eventually manipulate the electoral system. They might say it’s to correct flaws, to make it more fair, more similar to the rest of the world, or just to make it better. Don’t believe it. They wouldn’t be messing with it at all if it wasn’t to benefit them in some way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oppose any changes to electoral law that an authoritarian regime wants to enact – rest assured it’s only to help them remain in power longer.</p>
<p>And above all, be strong, fight, endure, and remember you’re on the good side of history.</p>
<p>EVERY authoritarian, totalitarian and fascist regime in history eventually failed, thanks to the PEOPLE.</p>
<p>– With love, your Eastern European friends</p>

<p>6 RULES for Survival under an Authoritarian Regime</p>
<p>Rule 1</p>
<p>Don’t stay indifferent. It WILL concern you eventually. It will concern your family, your friends. Voice your objection IMMEDIATELY. Show them you care. RESIST.</p>
<p>Rule 2</p>
<p>They thrive on FEAR &amp; IGNORANCE. Expose their scaremongering, show flaws in their arguments. Raise awareness, EDUCATE people around you. They will try to distort FACTS, rewrite history. DON’T LET THEM.</p>
<p>Rule 3</p>
<p>Organize protest movements, mobilize civil society. They’re well organized, so should you be. FLOOD THE STREETS. They WILL back off when they see your numbers. They depend on you – the PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Rule 4</p>
<p>Don’t let them DIVIDE you into different classes of citizens, “true Americans”, “patriots” vs “traitors”, “enemies of the state”. You’re ALL citizens, ONE nation, despite different beliefs and ideology. Make your diversity your STRENGTH. Stay TOGETHER for a common goal – survival of your country, of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>Rule 5</p>
<p>Don’t give up, don’t get tired, and don’t try to wait it out. Don’t hope it will pass. It WON’T. They will manipulate the people, control the media to sway public opinion, fix the electoral system and STAY FOR GOOD.</p>
<p>Rule 6</p>
<p>If you don’t get them to back off or to step down, you better make goddamn SURE that when the next elections come, assuming there’s still any democracy left, NO ONE will vote for the same bastard(s) again!</p>

<p>7 RULES on Approaching Authoritarian Supporters</p>
<p>What if your neighbour, friend or family member supports the authoritarian regime?</p>
<p>Rule 1</p>
<p>Don’t look down on them, don’t patronize them, even if you know what they’re saying has no factual basis or you find it offensive. Don’t preach, ask questions. Try to understand them, where they are coming from, what their problems are and why they see solutions to them in the regime. Treat them as people, as equals. They believe what they’re saying is true and they might have valid reasons for their support.</p>
<p>Rule 2</p>
<p>Don’t get emotional, don’t get provoked into heated arguments. Fight the other side’s emotions with your calm, logical approach. The angrier they get, the calmer you should be. They’ll calm down eventually.</p>
<p>Rule 3</p>
<p>Focus on what you have in common. Do you live in the same neighborhood? Do you work in the same company or sector? The smaller the community, the easier it is. Give examples, like “we all need to get this done for all of us, if we don’t cooperate neither of us will have it”.</p>
<p>Rule 4</p>
<p>Use their language, don’t treat it as inferior or below you – don’t seem patronizing (see rule 1). If they curse, curse with them. If they approach you with humor, don’t get angry or uptight about it, reply with humor. Show them you’re actually not that different (see rule 3). As long as you communicate on two different planes, you will never meet.</p>
<p>Rule 5</p>
<p>Don’t block their news sources, don’t turn away from their leaders and authority figures. Treat them as an insight to their worldview and tactics. Use them to your advantage, to better prepare for their arguments. Whenever you don’t agree with something or detect a lie, voice it calmly, expose it with factual arguments.</p>
<p>Rule 6</p>
<p>Pinpoint the practical, negative effects of their side’s actions, ones that affect them directly. Find examples of how they, their families, children or friends will be personally impacted by their policies, or how it will affect your shared community.</p>
<p>Rule 7</p>
<p>If all else fails, don’t turn away, don’t abandon your friends and family, don’t shun your neighbors. Remember, an authoritarian wants to divide you to control you. So invite them over to your BBQ, crack open a beer, and who knows, maybe they’ll realize you’re not so different after all.</p>
<p>– With love, your Eastern European friends.</p>

<p>Women are not a minority. In fact, men are.</p>

<p>It’s not a minority of population, it’s a minority of power.  The majority of the positions of power in our country are held by men.  This is what the author means by calling women a minority.</p>

<p>To find ways to connect, look to your local Indivisible chapter or look to local protests and rallies.  Almost every cause you care about has an organization that is political.  I belong to Save Our Schools and we fight to fully fund public schools, but now we are fighting for our democracy.  You can get connected!  Please do!</p>

<p>But how do you survive once they are in control? It’s happening at slow, but steady pace in the US and we don’t learn or change course until the worst possible scenario happens..</p>
<p>Everything we said would protect us, hasn’t; everything we said would hold, is breaking; and everything we said wouldn’t happen, is slowly happening. </p>
<p>What do we do? What do people who cannot be silenced until they are silenced, do? What happens when they take over and we’re completely under their control?</p>

<p>Nov is not going to save us, even if the repubs allow a Dem congress or pres to be seated — which I dont think they will allow. Biden has all the power in the world right now, and he refuses to do ANYthing — and Harris is pledging the same. They are both saying they wont lift a finger; in fact they havent lifted a finger. They tell us to go elect 60 Senators and then they’ll do something. We are in dire trouble, and what we need is as you say, advice on how to live under authortiarianism.</p>

<p>It has happened. They have “won” in a supposedly fair election. Project 2025,  the authoritarian handbook will be enacted on day one allegedly. Already they’ve corrupted the courts and oppressed women through denial of basic health care. We are quite far along this terrible path now.</p>

<p>So here we are. We have 2 months to prepare. What do we do? Our Economy is going to collapse and we will all likely be homeless or very close. I’m a single mom and need to know how I’m going to keep my kids alive, fed, and safe. I am starting a garden this weekend. There are vegetables you can start growing in the fall/winter.

<p>Doomerism is giving up your power without a fight. </p>
<p>It’s going to get bad but it’s important to remember, they have hurdles to overcome to enact their agenda. Appointing unqualified rapists for AG and Defense Secretary is psychological warfare above all. It’s a flex, intended to shock you.</p>
<p>We are still in the pre-game warmup; don’t let the scare tactics get to you. We have an important job: to stymie their vision and promote our own.</p>

When they start going after individuals in mass without qualm, then they will realize. By then it will have long been too late.</p>

<p>Yep it happened here too. Trump &amp; Co. did exactly what Mussolini, Hitler, Orban etc did. They just got tossed out before they could finish destroying the republic. They have NOT stopped trying, and they might very well win/steal the House and Senate in Nov 2020 and elect/appoint Trump in 2024. At that point the Republic is dead.</p>
<pre><code>My question is: will they create a Mussolini/ Putin/Orban style authoritarian regime, or full-blown Third Reich rule by terror?

<p>There is no doubt, in my mind anyway, that Trump would soon move to ruling by fear rather than working to earn faith within the people.  It is obvious his concerns are selfish and future actions will be vengeful towards his rivals and critics.  That will be the beginning of what will soon be hell on earth for all.  If he returns as President, our nation, as we know ( or knew ) it is doomed.</p>

<p>What has helped is knowledge of how dictators work to take over.</p>
<p>PBS in the US has 6 programs available called The Dictator’s Playbook.</p>
<p>One is on Hitler but the one I recommend is on Mussolini.</p>
<p>https://www.pbs.org/tpt/dictators-playbook/episodes/benito-mussolini/</p>
<p>And remember how Mussolini ended.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Trump has won everything — the White House, the Senate, the House, and he will have complete control of SCOTUS. The “American Experiment” is done, and we have ushered in an era of America under authoritarian rule. Trump won’t last his term, but Commander JD Vance is waiting to step in.</p>

<p>With the prospect of another Trump presidency I am doing all that I am able to in order to make sure my family and I are safe. If that means leaving the country, then we are working toward a smooth exit. That checklist is pretty much entirely checked off at this point in American history and democracy is in its final stages. I would rather resist from a safe distance where my family doesn’t have to live in fear, abject poverty, or worse.</p>

<p>My husband and I both studied nonviolence in theology school (we’re religious humanists). I was glad to come across this.  So many good people in the US are living in dread and I know Trump’s goal is to demoralize the public and convince us that resistance is useless.  Total nonsense.</p>

<p>This is similar to what is happening in Indonesia now, where President Joko Widodo is trying to maintain his power by changing the law on the age limit for vice presidential candidates, so that his children who do not meet the requirements can qualify for the vice presidential nomination.</p>

<p>I’ve seen reduced participation in public demonstrations in the USA over the last few years. What are some other ways to “fight”, especially for secure elections, independent media, etc. I’ve been writing letters and making calls but that doesn’t seem very much like “fighting.”</p>

<p>Join the League of Women Voters. Join Mobilize. Join Sunrise Movement. All of these are nationwide with local chapters and/or meetings. Meet with like minded people IRL at libraries, parks, pubs. Utilizing public spaces helps keep those public spaces open to the public. Join a Community Garden. Growing food is an act of resistance. Find neighborhood groups on social media. Volunteer to plant trees, pull up invasive weeds, and clean up rivers and lakes. Do good things; you’ll meet good people. Give to ACLU and abortion rights groups to help fund their lawyers. Stopping authoritarian rule this time is going to take a lot of court cases.</p>

<p>Though I’m praying it doesn’t come to this, as a believer in risk management, I’ve begun to wonder what, as a 71 year old retired widow, I should be doing to prepare for a possible Trump win and authoritarian takeover.  I’m sure they have plans in place for the hammer to fall on day one and I want to be prepared.  Should I transfer my assets into my sons’ names?  Just seeing that written down makes me feel like I’m overreacting but I’m really scared.</p>

<p>I fear it may be too late in the US to stop the Republicans from destroying the nation.  The dumbing down of Americans may be too far along to stop.  It seems that the party of Trump has started or completed a number of the steps listed above.  Especially when it comes to the Judicial side of the government, i,e. the lack of ethics in the Federal Supreme Court.</p>

Something told me to do research to prepare myself for the next 4 years and its crazy seeing people comment from 2 years ago warning how trump will use these tactics and fear to get the vote…hedid just that. Its crazy we are going through this but I do believe in the half the country that voted for the right side of history. Hopefully the United States will not fall for this..Hopefully I will grow old in my home country and be able to say we fought against this regime.</p>

We are fortunate to have dual citizenship (Canada/US) … will we be able to move out of the US or will they stop us at the border? It is HORRIFYING that we even have to think about this. What other things should we be taking care of before January 20th? </p>

<p>I would love a guide for how to discuss with those who have been suckered into propaganda. Nearly my entire family and friends voted for Trump even as I got them politically engaged (watching debates) and showed them what really happened Jan 6. They ignore me or don’t take him seriously when I share something like US announcement to take over Gaza, or taking immigrants to Guantanamo, or threat to make Canada the 51st “state.” I want to protect myself (minority here) but also know I have a civic duty.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that this travesty is coming to fruition just when most the WWII veterans have passed. I wonder how the people who fought fascism and saw its evil face in Europe would feel about the destruction of the American freedoms they sacrificed so much to protect.  Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris would all been President had women, young people, and people of color not been the victims of voter suppression in every election since at least 2000. Which is not to say that it hasn’t been happening before, especially for people of color.  Here we are in 2025, and as one who grew up in the 60s and 70s, so believed in the shining promise of the 21st century. But THIS Medusa just keeps on growing new heads, so it will be a longer battle to promote and nurture the best in human beings, and depose those who would promote the worst.  Sometimes creating a better future is a longer haul than we expect.</p>

<p>Reading comments spanning across years and sitting here today, in January 2025, and seeing it all unfold exactly as we feared. </p>
<p>Only ten days into Trump’s second term:</p>
<p>– Federal funding freeze causes chaos, confusion and total shutdown in all areas of the govt.</p>
<p>– Illegal firings of inspector generals and federal employees</p>
<p>– New federal employees must prove their loyalty to MAGA</p>
<p>– Transgender people banned from military service</p>
<p>– Across the board removal of any and all lgbt, racial minority, etc protections. Discrimination based on sex, sexuality, race, and religion is now legalized.</p>
<p>– Pressure on private companies to enact the same policies. Leading corporations like Amazon have caved, companies who refuse like Costco are threatened.</p>
<p>– Departure from WHO, shutdown of federal health organizations.</p>
<p>– An insane cabinet of sycophants</p>
<p>– This doesn’t even cover it all, and it’s been 10 days</p>

<p>About 20-25 years ago I had a dream that I was in Philadelphia PA on a beautiful sunny day where I saw our Founding Fathers, in spirit form.  They were rushing to get to an older brick building, so I asked, “Where are you going?”  One of our Founding Fathers answered that they were hurrying to a meeting because our Democracy is in danger! May we also hurry with them to save our Democracy “of, by and for the people” IT IS NOT FOR THE OLIGARCHS!!!</p>
<p>I hope all who have been helped, by democracy, and/or love democracy will help as best as they can. We must work together to get our democracy, our beloved land and country out of danger and working for the good of all sharing, kind and gracious beings.</p>

Dig into your local community by volunteering. Look for the helpers. Keep your circle of friends &amp; if possible, family. Stay grounded. I just wish the Democrats were more aggressive. They’re all talk &amp; no action. They need to back up the People &amp; shut down the Senate &amp; realize GOP are anti-democracy. Realize they try to align our enemies &amp; alienate our allies.</p>
