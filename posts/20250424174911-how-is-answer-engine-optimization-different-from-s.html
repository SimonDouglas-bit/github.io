<p>Is doing SEO enough for an AI chatbot visibility?</p>
<p>The industry is divided down the middle: Half believe that optimization for large language models (LLMs) requires new strategies, while the other half insists good SEO already handles it.</p>
<p>This division has spawned new acronyms like GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) – terms that are equally loved and hated.</p>
<p>To settle this debate, I analyzed Similarweb data comparing Google organic traffic with ChatGPT brand visibility across four product categories.</p>
<p>The top search players are not always the top ChatGPT players, and the overlap varies between product categories.</p>
<p>This is important to understand because:</p>
<p>At the same time, we can apply the same tactics to ChatGPT as to Google.</p>
<p>I like to think of how we describe the differences between SEO and GEO/AEO like this:</p>
<p>SEO and GEO/AEO are like pianos and guitars.</p>
<p>They’re both instruments. They both make music. And they both share fundamental principles (notes, scales, harmony) that a musician must master to properly play both.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Similarweb, especially Adelle and Sam, for sharing the data with me.</p>
<p>Here’s what I reviewed for this particular analysis:</p>
<p>If GEO/AEO and SEO were the same, the same sites getting organic traffic would also get the most citations/mentions in LLMs.</p>
<p>That’s only true in a few cases, but not for the overall picture.</p>
<p>The data shows that the top organic domains (by clicks) are not the ones getting the most mentions in ChatGPT.</p>
<p>As a result, just doing good SEO is not enough for LLM visibility when we look at specific domains.</p>
<p>Broad relationships between organic clicks and ChatGPT mentions tell a more nuanced story.</p>
<p>Whether or not “just doing good SEO” will be successful for LLM visibility can depend on the vertical or category.</p>
<p>In some verticals, AI chatbot optimization can really move the needle. In others, it might not help much.</p>
<p>Earbuds and CRM have a strong correlation between clicks and ChatGPT visibility.</p>
<p>Credit cards and handbags have a weak one.</p>
<p>In other words, credit cards and handbags are a much more open playing field for LLM optimization.</p>
<p>So clearly, that’s where optimizing for LLMs has the biggest payoff.</p>
<p>The differentiator is unclear.</p>
<p>The factors that likely play a role are:</p>
<p>But ultimately, we need more data to understand when product categories have a high or low overlap between AI visibility and organic search.</p>
<p>Besides the high correlation between organic and AI traffic, some categories have a higher degree of winner-takes-it-all dynamics than others.</p>
<p>In the CRM category, for example, three brands get almost 50% of visibility: Salesforce, HubSpot, and Google.</p>
<p>These dynamics seem to reflect market share – the CRM space is heavily dominated by Salesforce, HubSpot, and Google. (Google even thought about buying HubSpot, remember?)</p>
<p>In What content works well in LLMs?, I found that brand popularity has the strongest relationship with LLM visibility:</p>
<p>After matching many metrics with AI chatbot visibility, I found one factor that stands out more than anything else: brand search volume. The number of AI chatbot mentions and brand search volume have a correlation of .334 – pretty good in this field. In other words, the popularity of a brand broadly decides how visible it is in AI chatbots.</p>
<p>This effect is reflected here as well, and contextualized by market share.</p>
<p>Plainly, the more fragmented a category is, the higher the chance of gaining ChatGPT visibility.</p>
<p>This is great news for organizations or brands in emerging industries or products where there is plenty of room for competition.</p>
<p>However, categories that are dominated by a few brands are harder to optimize for LLM visibility, probably because there is already so much content on the web about these incumbents.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking, “Well, that’s not new, Kevin. That’s true of SEO, too.” I get it.</p>
<p>This information might feel fairly intuitive, but I’ve seen smaller brands or startups that heavily invest in high-quality SEO practices be able to find their way at the top of search results.</p>
<p>What the data I’m discussing today shows us is that it’s going to be even more challenging to optimize for LLM visibility in verticals or industries that are well-established and have long-time trusted incumbents dominating the vertical.</p>
<p>And depending on what vertical your site sits in, you’ll need to develop your organic visibility strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>So, here are the main takeaways from my findings:</p>
<p>Half of the community wants to put a new label on SEO; half says it’s the same.</p>
<p>Here’s where I think the disconnect stems from:</p>
<p>The fundamental principles overlap, but the implementation and context differ significantly.</p>
<p>Both SEO and GEO/AEO rely on these core elements:</p>
<p>Despite these shared foundations, how you optimize is different:</p>
<p>And like I mentioned at the start, SEO and GEO/AEO are like pianos and guitars.</p>
<p>They share fundamental musical principles, but require different techniques and additional knowledge to play both effectively.</p>
<p>And essentially, classic SEO professionals will need to train as multi-instrumentalists over time.</p>
<p>Despite the different dynamics, both SEO and GEO/AEO have the same optimizations:</p>
<p>The difference lies in how much attention you should pay to certain content categories and how resource allocation works.</p>
<p>Rather than creating an entirely new practice, it’s about understanding when and how to prioritize your efforts.</p>
<p>By the way, I also think it’s too early to coin a new acronym.</p>
<p>The AI and chatbot landscape is evolving rapidly, and so is search. We haven’t reached the final form of AI yet.</p>
<p>In some verticals with low correlation between search and AI visibility, there’s a significant opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>In others, your SEO efforts may already be giving you the visibility you need across both channels.</p>
<p>But I do expect GEO/AEO to differ more from SEO over time.</p>
<p>Why? The signals OpenAI gets from interaction with its models and from the richness of prompts should allow it to develop its own weighting signals for brands and answers.</p>
<p>OpenAI gets much better inputs to train its models.</p>
<p>As a result, it should be able to either:</p>
<p>Focus on understanding your category’s specific dynamics.</p>
<p>Are the SEO leaders in your category also dominating prompts on ChatGPT?</p>
<p>If so, focus on becoming a leader in search results.</p>
<p>If not, focus on becoming a leader in search and invest in monitoring and optimizing your visibility across relevant ChatGPT prompts with targeted content, PR campaigns, content syndication, and content repurposing across different formats.</p>
<p>And until we all see this technology evolve and distinguish itself further from traditional organic search, I say we just all stick with SEO as our agreed-upon acronym for what we do…</p>
<p>…at least for now.</p>
