        For decades, the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> world has been divided into two camps: black hat and white hat practitioners.
<p>These opposing forces have waged countless battles across digital forums and social media.</p>
But now, a new breed of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> has emerged.
One t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a>’s mastered the art of attention-grabbing and self-promotion.
Enter the “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat.”
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> practitioners who trade in social currency rather than business outcomes.
They’re not optimizing for search engines or users – they’re optimizing for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a>s.
<p>And it’s becoming one of the industry’s most pressing problems.</p>
Nowhere is the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat trend more visible than on LinkedIn, which has become the digital equivalent of a free marketing information bazaar.
Every day, self-proclaimed <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> experts flood the platform with: 
All available for the low price of a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> and comment.
<p>The formula is simple: </p>

<p>The most troubling aspect of this trend is the stark contrast between claims and evidence.</p>
Scroll through any social media platform, and you’ll find these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat practitioners boasting impressive metrics and revolutionary results.
<p>Yet dig deeper, and you’ll find an absence of verifiable success stories.</p>

<p>And here’s the scary part.</p>
Nobody cares t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> the evidence of results is absent because it’s all free.
Dig deeper: The great <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> heist: The untold story
<p>When I see these so-called “free” intellectual giveaways, I can’t help but ask:</p>
If these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> practitioners are truly successful, why are they giving away their “winning formulas” at no cost – especially when there’s no proof those formulas ever worked, even for themselves?
The answer lies in understanding the real business model behind like hat <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>.
The currency of like hat <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> isn’t results, it’s attention.
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat business model operates on a simple principle: 
<p>Flood social media platforms – X, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube – with promises of the fast track to success.</p>
<p>But it’s never just moderate success.</p>
<p>It’s always extraordinary.</p>
World-shattering <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> results, beyond imagination, delivered with suspicious ease.
This creates an illusion of expertise t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> serves as a funnel for selling:
<p>Everyone has to make a living, and no one is forcing a gun to the heads of clients to buy stuff.</p>
You could even argue t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> these people are doing “effective marketing.”
My gripe is t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> many of these posts are simply working back from the grand result.
We’re expected to believe that, as an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>, your approach made millions for the client, but not once did you ever mention that result?
T<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> in this game of attention, you forgot to mention the rankings you gained, the client success?
T<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> image doesn’t fit the rhetoric.
This is the core of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat mindset:
<p>Skip the learning. Skip the grind. Skip the actual work.</p>
<p>Why bother mastering your craft?</p>
Why spend years at agencies or in-house, navigating the real ups and downs of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> life?
<p>Why bother sharing your success and advice daily?</p>
<p>No, just start at the end result with a big, outlandish claim.</p>
This is the era of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> propaganda.
You start at the end. T<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a>’s the show –  a big, flashy end result easily achieved. 
Dig deeper: How to become exceptional at <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>
<p>Propaganda of any kind targets the lonely.</p>
<p>The ones wanting success out there are looking for those who have built it for themselves.</p>
If you’re an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> or business owner desperate for results, you’ll be drawn to something that gives you more agency in a world you don’t control.
<p>And you don’t control how people search or buy online.</p>
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> propaganda used by like hats appeals to the desires of other SEOs and business owners.
<p>It lifts them out of the daily grind.</p>
<p>It gives people a sense of community.</p>
<p>The counterargument is, “How do I know they aren’t telling the truth?”</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>I’ve run an agency.</p>
<p>I’ve worked at multiple 7-figure agencies.</p>
I’ve been the head of a huge <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> department.
<p>I’ve built teams and worked with some of the biggest brands in business.</p>
And there is rarely a blog t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> drives millions in revenue.
There isn’t a blog post framework t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> generates millions.
<p>And there isn’t a fast track to anything.</p>
<p>Every client and every industry is unique.</p>
<p>And behind the most successful clients will be huge PR teams and budgets.</p>
<p>Teams of writers, social media marketers, and more.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll have several agencies, each deployed in a different site category.</p>
<p>Success is never one thing.</p>
<p>And success is never easy.</p>
So, how do you spot the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hat from the white hat?
<p>The rise of fabricated case studies and manipulated graphics only underscores how far the industry has strayed from its purpose.</p>
So, how can you distinguish between like hat practitioners and legitimate <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> experts?
<p>Much more than this, there is always a digital footprint behind success.</p>
<p>From company revenue records, to client results, speaking gigs, case studies, and more.</p>
But above all else, these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>s tend to share their work openly but with realism.
They know that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> is: 
<p>And when they share their success, they provide context.</p>
Sadly, this will lead to fewer <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a>s and reach.
<p>But it’s vastly more realistic.</p>
<p>However, I think there is good news ahead.</p>
Dig deeper: So you’ve ‘won’ <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> – now what?
Online tools exist to allow users to find the most viral and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a>d posts and copy them.
It’s this t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> fuels the issue.
<p>And we’ve seen more AI-created posts flood social with each passing week.</p>
So, w<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> should we do?
I believe t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> this situation will resolve itself in time.
<p>You can smell the desperation with this approach.</p>
Like a piranha stripping its prey to the bone, the prospect of “free” will always drive the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> community into a frenzy.
<p>But over time, we will adapt to a tiered view of content.</p>
<p>Those tiers will be:</p>
The short form will exist, much <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> a stallholder at a busy marketplace. People will shout for the attention of passing prospects.
<p>And yes, sometimes they’ll draw a crowd with their singing.</p>
<p>However, as many stallholders rely on the same approach, customers seeking true knowledge and experience will seek out those who do the opposite.</p>
<p>Those who rely on long-form content to offer more considered views and expertise will attract those who avoid the cheap parlour content tricks.</p>
For this reason, I genuinely believe the era of the newsletter is the new entry fee to marketing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> this.
While anecdotal reports have shown t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a> newsletter sponsorship rates are declining, I believe this is because the newsletter will become the new normal.
<p>Be on LinkedIn, Substack, Medium, privately hosted, or any other platform.</p>
<p>Long-form content is becoming the new gold standard.</p>
<p>It’s harder to produce, demands real expertise, and comes with a higher barrier to entry.</p>
That’s exactly why <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">like</a> hats can’t compete.
<p>True thought leadership takes time, depth, and substance – none of which come easy.</p>
And t<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hat</a>’s why they avoid it.
