<p>All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. </p>
<p>Twitter threads.</p>
<p>Please stop; write a blog post instead.</p>
<p>All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. Twitter threads. Please stop; write a blog post instead.</p>
<p>As someone who has only really started using Twitter in the last few months (as I much prefer </p>
<p>Mastodon</p>
<p>) I've noticed that some people love nothing more than a good thread.</p>
<p>I assume it's because these people seem to get a tonne of followers off the back of these threads, thus perpetuating the whole thing and forcing more people onto that bandwagon.</p>
<p>What is a Twitter thread?</p>
<p>That's a fantastic question, dear reader. Basically, a Twitter thread is a collection of single Tweets that collectively make one story. It's common to have 10 or more Tweets in a single thread, but some times they get ridiculous.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<p>this thread</p>
<p>is </p>
<p>50 Tweets long</p>
<p>. Fifty. Tweets. Long!</p>
<p>What's my problem with threads?</p>
<p>Anyone who regularly reads my content will know </p>
<p>I've been blogging for a long time</p>
<p>, so I'm always going to be bias. But the issue I really have with these blasted threads boils down to one thing. </p>
<p>Context.</p>
<p>Using the example above, I became aware of it because someone that I follow re-tweeted Tweet number 47 in this ridiculously long thread. Because it was a random Tweet in a very long thread, I (and I imagine most other people reading the tweet) had absolutely no context as to what the whole saga was about.</p>
<p>It isn't the right platform</p>
<p>Secondly, Twitter isn't the right platform for long-form content. If it was, it wouldn't have a 280 character limit. It's a micro blogging platform; and as we all know, </p>
<p>micro</p>
<p>means small.</p>
<p>Surely a much better way of sharing long-form content would be to write a single coherent piece on a blog, then post a link to it on Twitter so your followers can read it in its entirety.</p>
<p>This also has the added benefit of decentralising content away from platforms like Twitter.</p>
<p>But Kev, not everyone knows how to setup a blog!</p>
<p>Non-bloggers everywhere</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it, most people don't have a blog, but </p>
<p>it's super simple</p>
<p>to start your one, or use a hosted provider, like </p>
<p>WordPress</p>
<p>. So there's no excuse really.</p>
<p>I know some people on Twitter who post threads regularly. Why can't these long-form threads become posts on a blog? It would be easier for people to consume, they can still post it on Twitter, and it has the added benefit of potentially creating a whole new audience for the creator.</p>
<p>I've seen some really interesting threads on Twitter that are full of useful information, but as a consumer of that content, it's a nightmare to follow. Content creators should make content as simple to consume as possible.</p>
<p>Closing thoughts</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just a dinosaur that needs to get with the times. If that's the case, I'll continue to die on this hill. I'd much rather own my content, and provide a coherent, easy to consume experience for my readers. Rather than trying to shoehorn a platform into submission just because it's the cool thing to do, or because it's the content creator's preferred platform.</p>
<p>I've tried posting a couple of Twitter threads myself, but both times I did it I found it awkward and confusing. Honestly, I don't get why people do it. For the likes? For the shares?</p>
<p>Help me out here folks. If you're a serial threader, please help me to understand what I'm missing. You can get in touch below.</p>
