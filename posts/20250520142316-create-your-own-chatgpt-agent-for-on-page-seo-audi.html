<p>Automate your SEO audits with a custom ChatGPT agent. Fetch HTML, analyze content, and implement actionable SEO recommendations effortlessly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is more than just a prompting and response platform. You can send prompts to ask for help with SEO, but it becomes more powerful the moment that you make your own agent.</p>
<p>I conduct many SEO audits – it’s a necessity for an enterprise site – so I was looking for a way to streamline some of these processes.</p>
<p>How did I do it? By creating a ChatGPT agent that I’m going to share with you so that you can customize and change it to meet your needs.</p>
<p>I’ll keep things as “untechnical” as possible, but just follow the instructions, and everything should work.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain the following steps”</p>
<p>At the end, you’ll have a bot that provides you with information, such as:</p>
<p>You’ll also receive a list of actionable steps to take to improve your SEO based on the agent’s findings.</p>
<p>Cloudflare Pages workers help your agent gather information from the website you’re trying to parse and view its current state of SEO.</p>
<p>You can use a free account to get started, and you can register by doing the following:</p>
<p>I used Google to sign up because it’s easier, but choose the method you’re most comfortable with. You’ll end up on a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<p>Navigate to Add &gt; Workers.</p>
<p>You can then select a template, import a repository, or start with Hello World! I chose the Hello World option, as it’s the easiest one to use.</p>
<p>Go through the next screen and hit “Deploy.” You’ll end up on a screen that says, “Success! Your project is deployed to Region: Earth.”</p>
<p>Don’t click off this page.</p>
<p>Instead, click on “Edit code,” remove all of the existing code, and enter the following code into the editor:</p>
<p>You have two things to do at this point:</p>
<p>This is the URL you’ll need in the next section. You can find it here:</p>
<p>Be sure to hit “Deploy” before exiting the screen. If you want to see the basic output at this stage, you can.</p>
<p>Paste your URL into your browser and add the following after the /?url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com.</p>
<p>Your URL will look something like this: https://YOURURL.workers.dev/?url=https://searchenginejournal.com.</p>
<p>Swap out the URL to one of your choosing to test this out. It’s not the “prettiest” at this stage, so it’s now time to move on to the fun part of configuring your own GPT.</p>
<p>Note: This worker is not working with JavaScript-rendered sites. But for everyone else using this agent, it should work fine. Feel free to improve it to work with JavaScript rendering.</p>
<p>You need to first configure your GPT, and you can do this by opening ChatGPT and going to “Explore GPTs,” or you can simply follow this link.</p>
<p>You’ll then go to “+ Create“:</p>
<p>Now, it will say “Create” and “Configure.” Go to Configure and start plugging in your information.</p>
<p>You can feel free to change things up a bit, but I recommend following everything I’m adding below to build the foundation of your auditor.</p>
<p>You’ll add what I’m going to list in this section:</p>
<p>Your configuration at this point should look something like this:</p>
<p>Review all of these fields and see if you have populated each properly before moving on to Create new action.</p>
<p>Navigate to Authentication and choose None.</p>
<p>Add the following ChatGPT action coding to the Schema field, but be sure to change the servers &gt; url field to your own URL. I’ll name it “https://CHANGETOYOURURL.com/” so that it’s easy for you to find.</p>
<p>You should see it under “Available actions: fetchAndAuditSEOData.”</p>
<p>Under Privacy Policy, add a link to your own privacy policy.</p>
<p>Finally, tap “Create” at the top right and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>You can now view your GPT; it will be similar to this On-Page SEO Audit GPT.</p>
<p>You’ve come a long way with your own GPT, and it’s time to test things out.</p>
<p>Tap on the second tile, “Analyze the SEO details.” It will default to example.com, but you can prompt it to test a URL you like.</p>
<p>Let’s try: netflix.com by prompting, “Use netflix.com as the URL.”</p>
<p>You can now experiment with any of the GPT options available to see how everything works together.</p>
<p>You may want to customize your GPT further by going back to where you created it and updating a few things.</p>
<p>Update your conversation starters to adjust:</p>
<p>If you like, go into the coding for your worker and add to “const userAgents” to add more user agents to the list.</p>
<p>You can now go to your custom GPT agent and simply prompt it on what page to scan next.</p>
<p>It’s easy to do this by prompting something like this: “Change the URL to THEDESIREDURL,” and your agent will get to work for you.</p>
<p>This custom GPT agent is just one example of how combining ChatGPT with Cloudflare Workers can streamline core SEO tasks.</p>
<p>Experiment with the Agent and change it for your needs.</p>
<p>AI has the capacity to help with many tasks and it’s here to stay. So, embracing this technology to be an assistant and an effective tool has possibilities to help SEOs be more efficient at scale.</p>
