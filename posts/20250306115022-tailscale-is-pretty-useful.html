                <p>Tailscale is pretty useful</p>

<p>It’s probably old news for most, but I’ve recently started using </p>
<p>Tailscale</p>
<p>and wanted to share my experience with it.</p>
<p>I’ve heard of Tailscale many times before, but didn’t get the appeal until recently. That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.</p>
<p>I know its local IP address and can </p>
<p>ssh</p>
<p>into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)</p>
<p>This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.</p>
<p>Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with </p>
<p>ssh raspberrypi</p>
<p>command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.</p>
<p>Some additional and surprising benefits:</p>
<p>Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for </p>
<p>ngrok</p>
<p>for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. </p>
<p>http://my-macbook-air:3000</p>
<p>) to effortlessly connect to your development server.</p>
<p>Taildrop</p>
<p>: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!</p>
<p>Exit nodes</p>
<p>: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.</p>
<p>Mullvad exit nodes</p>
<p>: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the </p>
<p>Mullvad partnership</p>
<p>, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like </p>
<p>iCloud Private Relay</p>
<p>. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.</p>
<p>I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called </p>
<p>Headscale</p>
<p>, which works with their client software.</p>
<p>If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!</p>
